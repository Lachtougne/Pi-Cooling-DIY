# Pi-Cooling-DIY – DIY Raspberry Pi Cooling: 25°C for ~$30  
**Repository**: `Pi-Cooling-DIY`

**Summary**  
Welcome to `Pi-Cooling-DIY`, a DIY cooling solution for Raspberry Pi 4 (and soon Pi 5). With a budget of around $30 (and some salvaged parts), this setup achieves performance comparable to much pricier commercial solutions. Here are the details:  

- **Thermal Performance**:  
  - 25.9°C max (average 25°C) under load (*Sega Rally*, 42.3% CPU, overclocked to 2 GHz).  
  - Idle at 22-23°C.  
  - Comparison: Commercial solutions under $40 (ICE Tower, Argon ONE) reach 45-65°C under load; at $100 (Pironman 5), 40-45°C; at $150 (custom watercooling), 26-28°C. This setup is 15-40°C more efficient than solutions under $100.

- **Transparent Budget**:  
  - Purchases: ~$30 (two Be Quiet! 92mm fans, Y-splitter, MX-6 thermal paste).  
  - Salvaged: PC heatsink (cut to size), bolts/nuts, external 9-12V transformer ($0).  
  - Without salvaged parts, estimated cost: ~$45.  
  - 5x cheaper than a custom watercooling setup ($150) for nearly identical performance (26-28°C), and 7-16x cheaper than extreme setups ($200-$500, 20-23°C).

- **Quiet Operation**:  
  - Be Quiet! 92mm fans at 9V (2000 RPM max at 12V), quieter than 30-40mm fans in commercial solutions.  
  - No throttling (threshold at 80°C), even with overclocking.

- **Tests**:  
  - Tested on a Pi 4 1GB overclocked to 2 GHz. CSV available in the repo (e.g., *Sega Rally*: 25.9°C max, 42.3% CPU).  
  - Planned for Pi 5 4GB (arriving April 8, 2025), with WLED and 144 NeoPixels for a glowing arcade machine.

**Conclusion**: `Pi-Cooling-DIY` is an accessible DIY project that shows how a bit of salvaging and ingenuity can compete with expensive solutions. Try it out, and share your own setups! #RaspberryPi #DIY #Cooling
